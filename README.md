IMidleyDespiseCSV

So i really hate csv the slowness of reading, its quite despicable the file format is not freindly. In an effort to dispose of this i decided to attempt a quick file reader which can handle up to x rows.

TODO::
1. MAke it so we have a lazy loader of data.
2. Not all data is passed at once
3. Some smaller changes.
